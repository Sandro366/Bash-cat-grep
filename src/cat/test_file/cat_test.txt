	September means its time again
for going off to school.
The days are getting shorter
and the nights are getting cool.

	October leaves are lovely
They rustle when I run
Sometimes I make a heap
And jump in them for fun.

	No shade, no shine,
No butterflies, no bees,
No fruits, no flowers,
No leaves, no birds,
Novemberi.
